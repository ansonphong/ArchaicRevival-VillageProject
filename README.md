### Fundamentals
The way of a Civilization is made by these primary means:
- knowledge
- mythos
- ethics
- trust
- technology


#### Knowledge


#### Mythos


#### Ethics


#### Trust
- knowledge educated, civil behavior, basic social trust
- mythologically agnostic - yet embracing all within the ethical manual
- taught by means of integrity
- principle of base systems of trust in a way that is optimized for robustness. Robustness is the best defense against corruption and penetration from forces outside of the human sphere, such as memes harmful to the society and the ecology
- trust is established by means of decentrallized node based architecture, as discovered in internet networks, synapses, mycelium, galaxy supercluseter
- humans carrying out relatively efficient optimized algorithms 
- these primal patterns applied as "mycelial networks" applied to human social sciences


#### Technology:
- language
- time
  - calendar
  - clock
  - timeline transformers
- address
  - location in space
- identity
  - markers
- transaction
  - money principle
  - storage of social energy
- coordination
  - communication systems
  - coordination between timelines

And not one to damage the earth. We count ourselves post 

From address, 

Drawing from all cultures, all wisdom,
