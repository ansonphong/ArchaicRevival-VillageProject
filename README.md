# Archaic Revival Village Project
The craft of civilization.
"A civilization is made of a thousand villages."

ðŸš§ Work in Progress

### Overview
Here we commit the knowledge of the humankind, lessons hard won by history to be preserved in digital and in print.

1. Surival - How to build a fire, a house, a garden.
2. Community - How to build a village, a town, a city.
3. Civilization - How to build a civilization (not an empire.)

## 1. Survival
Survival skills will keep people alive in the natural environment of planet earth and give a strong foundation to build a strong civilization.

Four requisites as taught by the Buddha for survival in the forest retreats:
- Food + Water
- Clothing
- Shelter
- Medicine

The true sovereigns of the earth will not depend exclusively on computer hardware for survival purposes. Computer hardware including smart phones are prone to malfunction, breakage and loss of connection in a true survival scenario and are likely of very little use except as a strategic coordination with other tribes over radio communication and GPS (when satellites operational.)

Ham radios should be moderately effective within local areas if protocols are maintained.

We propose the development of modular component computers and P2P radio technology based on mobile hardware that are low energy usage and with the component nature of PC computers, with modular attachable screens, batteries, antennae, and input interfaces with a lego-like power and data interface.

Also in a true survival scenaerio, electrical powered tools and modes of transportation (may) be more reliable as they can be charged in a decentrallized way such as through solar panels when petrol will not be widely available to the complexity and manufacturing and centrallization that is highly prone to sabotage.

Means of survival and their considerations:
- Food & Water
  - Energy
  - Nutrients
  - Healing
  - Hydration

- Clothing
  - Keeping warm
  - Fashion / pack signalling
  - Tactical
    - Construction
    - Camo

- Shelter Structures
  - Tents
    - Pole Tent
    - Teepee
    - Yurt
  - Domes
    - Geodesic Dome
    - Savana Tree Hut
    - Adobe Dome
    - Adobe Mud Hut
  - Open Structures
    - Open structures are the heart of the village. They shelter bypassers from the rain or the sun, and they provide the central watering hole to where villagers and bypassers can mingle
    - Open structures are also effective such as amphitheatres that could be build in the natural land formations
  - Closed Structures
    - Buildings and large dome structures that preserve airflow for insulating, heating or cooling spaces, and otherwise controlling the climate within an enclosure
    - Stone and brick structures
    - Hempcrete, aircrete
    - Tiber frame
  - Natural and Man Made Caves
    - See. Cappadocia, Turkey
    - See. Dogon Tribe Cave Dwellings
    - See. Lesotho's Kome Cave Dwellings

- Tools
  - Camping
    - Fire
  - Traveling
  - Gathering
    - Firewood
    - Berrys + Herbs
  - Gardening
  - Hunting
    - Forest + Mountain Hunting
    - Wetland Hunting
    - Ocean Fishing
    - Lake Fishing

- Hardware
  - Solar Panels + Batteries
  - Simple electric vehicles
  - Electric ATVs



#### /Tools /Camping /Fire
Types of fires and their uses:

- Campfire
  - For light and heat
- Bonfire
  - For community building


## 2. Community
- Crew
- Village
- Regenerative farming

## 3. Civilization
- Sustainable Industrialization
  - Lead by aborigional principles of symbiosis with the ecosystem
  - Build technologies and leverage plant technology to create beautiful productive ecosystems
  - Permaculture not monoculture garden based approaches to terraforming mega projects
    - See. Serpent Mound

- Symbols for pack signalling
  - Signalling symbols:
    - Tribe identity - symbol or lettering
      - see. japanese kamon symbols from fuedal japan
  - Purpose of pack signalling is to attract your tribe and signal to other members of the tribe your affiliation when travelling and marking town limits
  - The symbol also acts to repell members who would otherwise not affiliate with your tribe to keep the heart of the tribes strong and boundaries clear
  - This establishes a basic standard of the civilization in the form of a symbol protocol
  - This is a higher level symbolic interface for many variations to emerge from
  - Mating Ritual Symbols
    - Signals if any members from each tribe are looking for singles in the approaching tribe
      - After meeting the tribes can choose to acknowledge a mutual gathering with the scope as mutually agreed upon
      - Sometimes just the leaders may speak while the tribe remains in a campsite on the edge of town
    - Singles for hooking up, mating and gene swarm cross-pollination, child bearing
      - Cross pollination rituals for tribes is traditional practice to diversify the blood of the tribes that prevents inbreeding in small village situations
      - Based on customs as mutually agree upon
      - Not all villages will be compatible due to mythological presuppositions


- Principle of non-interference
  - Non interference with the environment
  - No interference with other tribes
  - Live in harmony with the all in the one
  - Law of interference - courts of interference
    - Judge then they who interfere less as a way to show harmony
    - Members deemed to break the terms are duely punished by mutualy agreed upon terms by both tribes as adhering to the mathematically guided symbol protocol algorithm for law and justice
    - Symbol Algorithm To Unify peace and Render Neutrality - S.A.T.U.R.N.



Difference between a civilization and an empire.
  - Customs vs control structures

### Structures
- Town
  - Leadership Structure
- City
  - Study of Black Rock City
- Networking
- Trade

### Fundamentals
The way of a Civilization is made by these primary means:
- knowledge
- mythos
- ethics
- trust
- technology


#### Knowledge


#### Mythos


#### Ethics


#### Trust
- knowledge educated, civil behavior, basic social trust
- mythologically agnostic - yet embracing all within the ethical manual
- taught by means of integrity
- principle of base systems of trust in a way that is optimized for robustness. Robustness is the best defense against corruption and penetration from forces outside of the human sphere, such as memes harmful to the society and the ecology
- trust is established by means of decentrallized node based architecture, as discovered in internet networks, synapses, mycelium, galaxy supercluseter
- humans carrying out relatively efficient optimized algorithms 
- these primal patterns applied as "mycelial networks" applied to human social sciences


#### Technology:
- language
- time
  - calendar
  - clock
  - timeline transformers
- address
  - location in space
- identity
  - markers
- transaction
  - money principle
  - storage of social energy
- coordination
  - communication systems
  - coordination between timelines


## City Craft
Building a city is a long term project that requires the participation of many mutually shared interests and ability to thrive in the given location. Cities vary a lot in their technology and lifetyle.

### NOTES:

Surival - How to build a fire. 
And not one to damage the earth. We count ourselves post 

Drawing from all cultures, all wisdom, 

- Community
  - Villiage structure - 100-144
  - Diversity vs. Interest Groups
- Symbols for Social Signalling
- Federation Protocols of Mutual Agreement
  - The universal law shows how tribes band to support one another in The Law of non interference

- Ritual
  - Offerings
  - Gatherings
  - Mating across villiages
    - Some villiages may choose to adopt cross pollination rituals
  - No guidlines are to be put forth by the federations such that would violate the soverignty of individual freedoms within their field of non-interference pattern

#### Preindustrial Japan
- Temples - Bridges - Homes - Lifestyle - Villages - Towns - Cities - Castles - Art


#### The Fifth World
